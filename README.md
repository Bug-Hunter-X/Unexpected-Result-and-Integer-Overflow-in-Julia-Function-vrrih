This repository contains a Julia function that demonstrates an uncommon error related to integer overflow when handling negative input. The function aims to square positive numbers and return 0 for non-positive inputs. However, it fails to handle negative inputs correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior and, in some cases, an error due to integer overflow. The solution provided addresses this issue with proper type handling and error prevention.  The `bug.jl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.jl` presents the corrected version.
